# TicTacToe

This is my implementation of the [TicTacToe](https://github.com/data61/fp-course/blob/master/projects/TicTacToe/TicTacToe.markdown) exercise in Tony Morris' fp-course.

I have attempted to fulfil all the requirements.

The User Interface is implemented in Brick.

The build tool is `cabal`, using the `new-*` commands.

- Build (and install dependencies) with `cabal new-build`
- Test with `cabal new-test`
- Run with `cabal new-run ticx`
