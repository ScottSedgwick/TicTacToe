# tic

This is my implementation of the [TicTacToe](https://github.com/data61/fp-course/blob/master/projects/TicTacToe/TicTacToe.markdown) exercise in Tony Morris' fp-course.

I have attempted to fulfil all the requirements, with this exception - rather than use CABAL and include a .ghci file, I built with Stack.

The User Interface is implemented in Brick.
